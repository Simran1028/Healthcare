#  Patient Waitlist Analysis Dashboard - Power BI Project

##  Objective
- Track the current status of the patient waiting list.
- Analyze historical trends in monthly waitlist volumes for Outpatient, Day Case, and Inpatient categories.
- Provide drill-down insights by medical specialty and patient age profiles to support better healthcare planning and resource allocation.


## Questions
- ðŸ“Š How many patients are currently on the waitlist, and how does this compare to the previous year?
- ðŸ“ˆ What are the trends in waitlist volumes across case types (Outpatient, Day Case, Inpatient) over time?
- ðŸ‘¶ðŸ§“ How do age groups and time bands affect waitlist duration?
- ðŸ©º Which specialties have the highest average or median waiting times?
- ðŸ•’ What is the distribution of wait times by archive date and how does it vary by case type?

## Process
- Data Source: Patient waitlist data including Archive Date, Case Type, Specialty, Age Profile, and Wait Time metrics.
- Steps:

    - Data Cleaning: Handled missing and inconsistent entries, ensured date format compatibility.

    - Data Modeling: Created relationships between archive date, patient categories, and specialty tables.

    - Visualizations:
      -- KPIs for current vs previous month waitlist.
      -- Pie chart for case type distribution.
      -- Bar charts for waitlist by time bands and age profiles.
      -- Line graphs for time series analysis.
      -- Drill-down table for detailed breakdowns by specialty and age.
